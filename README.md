This GMD project was a very interesting but at the same time challenging task, as I was
developing it all by myself. <br />This allowed me to choose all the mechanics, dynamics and
aesthetics of the game myself, so I chose to make a challenging game - a simple 3D platformer
which would drive people crazy until they passed all of it.<br />
I think I succeeded to do so, because I spent time arranging the elements of the game in such a
way that it is barely possible to pass, but still possible. Sometimes, the player has to run in order
to reach a specific platform, and there are no hints.<br />
During the development of the game, I adhered to some of the SOLID principles, so I can reuse
the prefabs, combine them and make it harder to pass the later levels without writing any code.
For example, the moving platforms move faster with each level. The slippy wedges get more
and more slipy, so the player falls faster out of them. Also, combining a Trampoline with a
moving platform makes it challenging to pre-calculate the movements.<br />
In general it was a fun experience, but also took a whole bunch of time, especially when I was
running into problems, it took a long time for me to figure stuff out. I still have some little bugs in
the UI, which I plan to patch up after the hand in.<br />
